Apache Status Plugin
======================

Created by Hampton Catlin
Modifications and documentation by Josh Nichols

Overview
--------

Reports data back from the [mod_status](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/mod_status.html) Apache module, including:

 * Idle workers
 * Requests being handled
 * Apache reserved memory size

Configuration
-------------

The Apache Server Status page ([sample:](http://www.apache.org/server-status?auto
)) must be accessible for the plugin to report stats. See [this guide](http://www.debian-administration.org/article/Monitoring_Apache_with_mod_status
) for instructions on configuring the status page.

Known limitations
-----------------

 * path and name of `apache2ctl` command is not configurable
 * not all values are reported from `apache2ctl status` yet
